### Do first babies arrive late?

Analyzing the data 2002  pregnancies containing approximately 7500 births. The distribution shows that approximately 2000 first births and 2500 other births (roughly 4500 births) occurred on week 39. An additional 500+ first births with another 500+ other births occurred on week 40. Out of the remaining 2000 babies, the majority are well balanced between first and other births and tend to stay close to the average with a good balance or early and late births between weeks 35 and 43. So the trend is that first babies do not tend to arrive late.
