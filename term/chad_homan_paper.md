# Statistical/Hypothetical Question 

Is Linux more secure than Windows? 

# Outcome of your EDA 

I feel my analysis was good. In my opinion linux is far more secure then 
windows and I feel the data would have showed that. However, Microsoft as
a private company is notorious for not being forthcoming with
vulnerabilities.

Also, linux is used by many operating systems. I targeted Ubuntu as it is a 
very popular choice amongst linux enthusiast's. Although across 600+ Linux 
based distributions, a given vulnerability affects them all and a given solution
affects them all.

Whereas my experience with Windows, a given fix rarely applies to all desktops
and server releases. Which is disappointing that WIndows cannot create a single 
fix that satisfies multi desktop and servers like a single Linux fix can.  This is 
more than likely due to the single baseline that the bulk of Linux based systems
utilize. 

# What do you feel was missed during the analysis? 

Most of what I feel I missed is how Windows and Linux declare and resolve 
a CVE against a given thing like a desktop or server. This I believe was a 
factor in determining an answer to my question.

# Were there any variables you felt could have helped in the analysis? 

No, I could have added more Linux distributions to my list of operating 
systems. But I do not think that would have changed any results.

# Were there any assumptions made you felt were incorrect? 

I do not feel there were any assumptions that I made that were incorrect. Most
of the community I am in knows how Microsoft operates. This knowledge makes 
determining a question like mine difficult. Also there is a concept of the 
mean time of a vulnerability. In my experience, Linux does a great job responding
to vulnerabilities as they are announced by usually already having them resolved.

To elaborate, when a vulnerability is discovered, a community has a period of time
to resolve the issue before it is announced to the world. This gives that community 
time to resolve the discovered vulnerability before "crackers" and crime organizations
can take advantage of the discovery. And thats to most Linux distributions repository 
process, the patch is usually implemented even before announcement of the vulnerability.
Once again proving a superior system to utilize for day-to-day operations.


# What challenges did you face, what did you not fully understand?

The challenges I faced were all statistics. I did not realize going into this class
that things would have been so statistic heavy. As a result, I feel the final project 
is hindered due the lack of my understanding of the heavy statistics the appear to be 
required. This is reflected in my understanding of what the statistics tell me about 
my dataset.

I also did not understand how to break down my variable to provide anything meaningful 
in the things required for the slide deck, as a result my slide deck suffered.
