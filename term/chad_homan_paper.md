# Statistical/Hypothetical Question 

# Outcome of your EDA 

I feel my analysis was good. In my opinion linux is far more secure then 
windows and I feel the data would have showed that. However, Microsoft as
a private company is notorious for not being forthcoming with
vulnerabilities.

Also, linux is used by many operating systems. I targeted Ubuntu as it is a 
very popular choice amongst linux enthusiast's. Although across 600+ Linux 
based distributions, a given vulnerability affects them all and a given solution
affects them all.

Whereas my experience with Windows, a given fix rarely applies to all desktops
and server releases. Which is disappointing that WIndows cannot create a single 
fix that satisfies multi desktop and servers like a single Linux fix can.  This is 
more than likely due to the single baseline that the bulk of Linux based systems
utilize. 

# What do you feel was missed during the analysis? 



# Were there any variables you felt could have helped in the analysis? 



# Were there any assumptions made you felt were incorrect? 


# What challenges did you face, what did you not fully understand?

The challenges I faced were all statistics. I did not realize going into this class
that things would have been so statistic heavy. As a result, I feel the final project 
is hindered due the lack of my understanding of the heavy stastics the appear to be 
required. This is reflected in my understanding of what the statistics tell me about 
my dataset.
